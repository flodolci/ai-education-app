# Welcome to the **AI Explorers Playground**!

Today, we'll dive into the world of **Linear Regression**, discovering its mathematics step by step. Think of linear regression as your gateway to understanding 
the basics of AI - an intuitive and accessible model whose potential is often underestimated.

You're invited to upload your own CSV file below to see how linear regression works on your data. At the end of the analysis, you'll find a detailed explanation of 
the results. If you don't have a CSV file on hand, no worriesâ€”there's a sample dataset waiting for you in the `data` folder of this project.

Let's get started!
